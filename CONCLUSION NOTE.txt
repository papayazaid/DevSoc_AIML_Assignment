What I learned and how I learned it

In this assignment, I learned how to work with APIs and how to make them interact with AI models.
I understood what an API key is, how to use it safely, and how to send requests to an LLM API to get responses.
I also learned how to handle text files in Python â€” reading questions from a file, sending them to the model, and saving all the answers in a JSON file.
This helped me understand how AI can be connected to normal programs and how data is transferred through APIs.

In the second part, I learned about linear regression and how it can be used to find relationships between two sets of numbers.
I created a simple dataset of DevSoc coordinators, using their event preparation hours and their performance scores.
I used Python and Google Colab to calculate the line of best fit and plot a graph that shows how more preparation leads to higher scores.
It made the math behind machine learning feel more real and easier to understand.

Overall, I learned how coding, data, and AI can come together to build small but meaningful projects.
This assignment helped me connect theory with practice and gave me more confidence in using Python for AI and ML tasks.

YEP, I LOVED WORKING ON THIS PROJECT AND I HOPE I GET INDUCTED INTO THIS VERTICAL. THANK YOU.
